# Traffic Light Controller using FSM

## Description
This project implements a traffic light controller using a finite state machine (FSM).
It controls Red, Yellow, and Green LEDs with fixed timing similar to real traffic signals.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- Red LED
- Yellow LED
- Green LED
- Resistors
- Wokwi Simulator

## Working
The system follows these states:
- RED
- RED + YELLOW
- GREEN
- YELLOW

Each state runs for a predefined duration and transitions automatically.

## Simulation
The project was simulated using Wokwi.
