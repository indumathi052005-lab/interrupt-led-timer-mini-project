# Interrupt-Driven LED Control (Mini Embedded Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This mini project demonstrates basic embedded system concepts such as GPIO control,
timer-based operation, and interrupt-driven execution using register-level embedded C.

The project is designed as a learning-focused mini project and is suitable for
beginners in Embedded Systems and ARM Cortex-M architecture.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand GPIO register configuration
- Learn timer-based execution instead of delay loops
- Demonstrate interrupt-driven design
- Follow a clean embedded project structure

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Memory-Mapped I/O
- GPIO Registers
- Hardware Timer Concept
- Interrupt Handling
- Polling vs Interrupt (conceptual comparison)

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Visual Studio Code (or Notepad / Notepad++)
- Embedded C
- Windows OS

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
- GPIO pin PA5 is configured as output
- A hardware timer concept is used to toggle the LED
- Timer interrupt logic is simulated
- No blocking delay loops are used for timing control

## 🧪 Note on Execution
This project is implemented and validated in a virtual environment.
The same logic can be directly ported to real ARM Cortex-M hardware
with minimal changes.
